    """An abstract Clarion (micro)feature.

    In Clarion, (micro)features are implicit, connectionist representations. 
    They are represented as dimension-value pairs:
        e.g. (Color: White), (Shape: Star)
    In this implementation, dimensions are represented by subclasses of the 
    Feature class, which is itself an enumeration class. Members of Feature 
    subclasses correspond to individual dimension-value pairs.

    For details on dimension-value pairs, see Chapter 3 of Sun (2016), starting 
    with Section 3.1.2.1.
