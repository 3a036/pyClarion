"""This module provides several classes for tracking important statistics for 
the Clarion cognitive architecture.

Classes are defined for tracking the following statistics:
    - Base-level activations (Sun, 2016, Sections 3.2.1.3 & 3.2.2.2)
    - Match statistics (Sun, 2016, Section 3.3.2.1)

Warning: In general, these classes are defined only as containers and updaters 
for the relevant statistics. They do not store additional information about 
related constructs, such as references to the objects of the statistics they 
store.
