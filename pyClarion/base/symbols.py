class ConstructSymbol(typ.NamedTuple):
    """
    General base class for symbols representing simulation constructs.
    
    Construct symbols are used to identify and carry essential information 
    about key simulated constructs in a lightweight manner.

    Every construct symbol is expected to present a construct type in its 
    `type` field, and a construct id in its `id` field. Construct types are 
    used in the control of activation flows, construct ids serve to disambiguate 
    and identify construct symbols of a given type. 
    
    In general, each construct symbol is associated with at least one construct 
    realizer, which defines the behavior of the model vis Ã  vis that construct 
    in some particular context. For information on construct realizers see
    ``pyClarion.base.realizers``.
