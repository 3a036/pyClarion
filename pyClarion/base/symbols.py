"""
Tools for naming and indexing simulated constructs.

This module defines construct symbols, which are symbolic tokens that may be 
used to name, index, and reference simulated constructs. 

The construct symbol class hierarchy reflects the different kinds of constructs 
that may be in use within a simulation. Each distinct kind of construct symbol 
is implemented as a frozen dataclass. 

When a construct symbol class has data fields, symbol equality is based on the 
equality of data field values, otherwise construct symbol equality is instance 
based. Construct symbol classes that do not have data fields are intended as 
base classes and are not expected to be directly instantiated within 
simulations.
