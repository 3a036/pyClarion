"""This module provides tools for computing and handling node activations in the 
Clarion cognitive architecture. 

Activations may flow from chunks to chunks (rules), chunks to features 
(top-down activation), features to chunks (bottom-up activation), and features 
to chunks or features (implicit activation). Activations may also be filtered at 
various stages based on input from the meta-cognitive subsystem (MCS) or other 
sources. Furthermore, activations from several different sources may need to be 
combined. For example, activations from the top and bottom levels of the 
action-centered subsystem (ACS) may need to be combined in order to complete an 
action-decision making cycle. 

Here, the various processes described above are captured by means of two 
abstractions: activation channels and junctions. Activation channels implement 
mappings from node activations to node activations. They may be used to 
represent, among others, filtering, top-down activation, bottom-up activation, 
rule-based activation, and implicit activation processes. Activation junctions 
implement routines for combining inputs from various sources. They may be used, 
for example, for combining activations from the top and botom levels of the ACS 
for action decision-making.

For details of activation flows, see Chapter 3 of Sun (2016). Also, see Chapter 
4 for a discussion of filtering capabilities of MCS.

####### ABSTRACTIONS #######

class ActivationChannel(abc.ABC):
    """An abstract class for capturing activation flows.

    This class provides a uniform interface for handling activation flows. It 
    is assumed that activations will be represented as mappings from nodes to 
    activation values. Thus, activation channels expect such mappings as input, 
    and return such mappings as output. Output mappings are allowed to be empty 
    when such behavior is sensible.
    
    It is assumed that an activation channel will pay attention only to the 
    activations that are relevant to the computation it implements. For 
    instance, if an activation class implementing a bottom-up connection is 
    passed a bunch of chunk activations, it should simply ignore these and look 
    for matching (micro)features. 
    
    Likewise if an activation channel is handed an input that does not contain 
    a complete activation mapping for expected nodes (e.g., due to filtering), 
    it should not fail. Instead, it should have a well-defined default behavior
    for such cases.
