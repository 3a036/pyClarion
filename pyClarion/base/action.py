"""This module provides tools for handling actions in the Clarion cognitive 
architecture. 

There are two steps to action handling: action selection and action execution. 
These two steps are handled separately by the ChunkSelector and ActionHandler 
classes, respectively.

For basic details on action selection, see Chapter 3.1.2.3 of Sun (2016). See
also Section 3.4.2 on memory retrieval actions, Section 4.2.3 for possible 
goal-setting actions and Section 4.3.2 for other possible metacognitive actions.
