"""This module defines the basic representational constructs of the Clarion 
cognitive architecture.

Overall, the most basic representational construct in Clarion is a connectionist 
node: an individual unit that may be connected to other units and whose 
activation depends on the activation of other units in its network and the 
strength of incoming connections. 

Clarion has a dual representational architecture, meaning that there are, 
broadly, two kinds of node: (micro)features and chunks. These two types of node 
are represented by the Feature and Chunk classes respectively. A number of 
types related to these two classes are also provided for facilitating type 
hints in collaborator classes. There is no generic Node class, however a Node 
type is defined (as the union of Feature and Chunk). Node-related utility types 
are also provided for convenience.

For details on representation in Clarion, see Chapter 3 of Sun (2016).
