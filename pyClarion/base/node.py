"""This module defines the basic representational constructs of the Clarion 
cognitive architecture.

The most basic representational construct in Clarion is a connectionist node: 
an individual unit that may receive activation from and propagate activation to 
other units. 

Clarion has a dual representational architecture. There are two kinds of nodes: 
microfeatures and chunks. These two types of nodes are represented by the 
Microfeature and Chunk classes respectively. A number of types related to these 
two classes are also provided for facilitating type hints in collaborator 
classes.

For details on representation in Clarion, see Chapter 3 of Sun (2016).
