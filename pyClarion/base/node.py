Tools for capturing fundamental representational constructs.

Usage
=====

The most basic representational construct in Clarion is the connectionist node: 
an individual unit in a network that may receive activation from and propagate 
activation to other units. In Clarion, there are two essential kinds of node: 
microfeatures and chunks. 

This module provides the ``Microfeature`` and ``Chunk`` classes, implemented as 
frozen dataclasses, for representing microfeatures and chunks respectively, 
along with other related utilities.

You may create ``Microfeature`` and ``Chunk`` instances to represent nodes known
to a Clarion agent. Below, a microfeature node representing the dimension-value 
pair ``('color', 'red')`` and a chunk node with id ``1234`` are defined:

>>> mf = Microfeature(dim='color', val='red')
>>> ch = Chunk(id=1234)

The ``Microfeature`` and ``Chunk`` classes are subclasses of the Node class. 

>>> isinstance(mf, Node)
True
>>> isinstance(ch, Node)
True

``Node`` objects are meant to be used as ``Mapping`` keys. Their intended role 
is to allow easy and uniform retrieval of information related to the nodes they 
represent within the theoretical context of a particular model. To this end, 
they are implemented as frozen dataclasses. This implementation ensures the 
usability of ``Nodes`` as keys and allows for some extensibility. Many different 
kinds of information relevant to a Clarion agent may be stored using 
``Mapping`` objects while keeping coupling to a minimum.

For instance, ``pyClarion.base.activation.packet`` provides container 
classes for node activations. These containers are implemented as ``Mapping`` 
objects which expect ``Node`` objects as keys and activation strengths as values. 
Informing some consumer about a particular activation pattern is as simple as 
passing a container carrying the relevant pattern. Similar patterns may be used 
for implementing action callbacks (for interaction with the environment), node 
related statistics and other constructs.

Equality Checking
-----------------

Microfeature and Chunk instances compare equal iff the contents of their data 
fields are equal. Below, ``mf`` compares equal to a new Microfeature instance 
that happens to be initialized with the same dimension and value. Likewise, 
``ch`` compares equal to a new Chunk that happens to be initialized with the 
same id.

>>> mf == Microfeature('color', 'red')
True
>>> ch == Chunk(1234)
True

Here are a few false equality comparisons:

>>> mf == Microfeature('color', 'blue')
False
>>> mf == Microfeature('code', 'red')
False
>>> ch == Chunk('COLOR')
False

Attributes
----------

``Microfeature`` and ``Chunk`` instances are frozen. Attempting to set new 
or existing attributes will cause an error:

>>> mf.dim = 'code'
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'dim'
>>> ch.my_attribute = 'some data'
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'my_attribute'

However, it is possible to subclass ``Microfeature`` or ``Chunk`` in order to 
add additional fields, as shown below.

>>> from typing import Hashable
>>> @dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)
... class MyMicrofeature(Microfeature):
...     meta : Hashable
>>> MyMicrofeature('color', 'red', 'some metadata')
MyMicrofeature(dim='color', val='red', meta='some metadata')

Node Objects
------------

The ``Node`` class is included as a base class for ``Microfeature`` and 
``Chunk`` and as a convenience for possible future extensions to Clarion. It is
not intended to be directly used. Nevertheless, ``Node`` objects can be created
just like ``Microfeature`` or ``Chunk`` objects, but behave rather differently.

Most importantly ``Node`` objects have no data fields.

>>> n = Node()

Consequently, ``Node`` equality is instance-based. Below, the node ``n`` 
compares equal to itself but not to another newly created node.

>>> n == n
True
>>> n == Node()
False
