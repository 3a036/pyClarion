    A simple rule database.

    This object provides methods for constructing, maintaining, and inspecting a 
    database of associative links from condition chunk nodes to conclusion chunk 
    nodes.

    Each rule has the form 
        conclusion <- condition_1, condition_2, ..., condition_n
    Each condition may be associated with a weight.

    Rules are stored in a dict of the form
    _data = {
        chunk("conclusion-1"): [
            {chunk("condition-1"): w1, ...}, # a first set of conditions
            ... # other condition sets for conclusion 1
        ],
        ...
    }
    
    Under normal cricumstances, this dict should not be directly accessed and/or 
    modified. However, a dict of this form may be passed at initialization time 
    to set initial rules.

    The key `chunk("conclusion-1")` represents a conclusion chunk, the value 
    associated with this key is a list of dicts. Each dict in this list 
    represents the condition chunks and weights for a different rule whose 
    conclusion is the chunk represented in the top-level key.

    The conclusion and condition chunk symbols together are called the rule 
    form. Rules methods enforce the uniqueness of rule forms within the 
    database.
