    Propagates activations between chunks and features.

    Features are linked to chunks by dimensional weights ranging in (0, 1] 
    (same dimension = same weight). 
    
    During a top-down cycle, chunk strengths are multiplied by dimensional 
    weights to get dimensional strengths. Dimensional strengths are then 
    distributed evenly among features of the corresponding dimension that 
    are linked to the source chunk. 
    
    During a bottom-up cycle, chunk strengths are computed as a weighted sum 
    of the maximum activation of linked features within each dimension. The 
    weights are simply top-down weights normalized over dimensions.
