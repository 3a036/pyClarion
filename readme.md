# pyClarion Readme

This is a python implementation of the Clarion cognitive architecture. 

To grasp the architecture of this codebase, the recommended reading order is:
    
1. `pyClarion.base.node`
2. `pyClarion.base.activation`
3. `pyClarion.base.subject`

Many common Clarion constructs are implemented in their default forms in 
`pyClarion.default.common.py`. These constructs are combined in 
`examples/raven_matrix.py`  in order to demonstrate how they may be used to 
create simulations in the Clarion framework. 

Implementation of larger constructs, such as individual subsystems are 
forthcoming. 

## Implementation Goals

This package aims to satisfy the following goals:

1. Be True to the Source Material: The code should reflect the source text(s) as 
closely as possible. However, superficial deviations from original descriptions 
are acceptable if strict adherence would lead to unnecessary complexity or 
inefficiency.
2. Have One Class For Each Construct: Every major construct should be 
represented by one class that encapsulates its core functions. This does not 
mean every class should correspond to a construct, there may be interfaces, 
abstractions, and utility classes that do not directly correspond to existing 
constructs.
3. Have a Simple Interface with the Simulation Environment: It should be easy 
to transfer data between Clarion constructs and the wild.
4. Prioritize Clarity Over Optimization: The code should be easily interpretable 
whenever possible. Code should not be optimized at the expense of clarity.
5. Have Minimal Dependencies: The code should rely on standard or major 
libraries whenever possible.
6. Be Compositional: The code architecture should allow for components to be 
swapped in and out easily. So, if only a subset of functionality is desired 
(e.g., for prototyping/experimentation), it should be possible to implement 
that subset with minimal effort.
7. Be Extensible: It should be easy to experiment with new constructs or 
alternative implementations.
8. Be Maintainable: Every object should have a singular, well-defined, 
documented role. Type hints should be included. Assumptions, exceptions, 
failure cases should be documented whenever possible. There should be thorough 
unit tests for all methods and functions. 

These goals are roughly in order from most to least specific.
