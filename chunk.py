    """A basic Clarion chunk. 

    In Clarion, chunks are explicit, localist representations. They live in the 
    top level and may be connected to (micro)features, which live in the bottom 
    level. Activation may flow from (micro)features to linked chunks (bottom-up 
    activation), or it may flow from chunks to (micro)features (top-down 
    activation).

    Only essential features of Clarion chunks are represented in this class. 
    More advanced or specialized features may be added using specialized Mixin 
    classes (see, e.g., bla.BLAMixin).

    This implementation is based on Chapter 3 of Sun (2016).
