### SETUP ###
#############

# This example will be addressing the basics of control in pyClarion. By way of 
# example we present a simple recipe for controlling the mode of reasoning. We 
# will extend the model presented in `free_association.py` to support control 
# of the mode of reasoning.

# In the proposed recipe, control of the mode of reasoning is achieved by 
# gating the output of various flows present in the original model. Gating is 
# implemented by an emitter that wraps the base emitter of the flow and 
# multiplicatively gates its output according to gating parameters received 
# from a parameter buffer. The parameter buffer is modeled using a ParamSet 
# emitter, which roughly captures the concept of a psychological set (e.g., 
# task set, goal set, perceptual set, etc.). It can be configured by a 
# controller to store and emit parameters to input filters, output gates, and 
# other parametric processes.

### Knowledge Setup ###

# The semantic feature domain used in this simulation is identical to that used 
# in `free_association.py`, so we do not specify again here. 

# To control emitter gating, we need to specify a feature interface. In 
# general, pyClarion emitters that are subject to control specify constructors 
# for their control interfaces. These constructors offer a standardization of 
# control interfaces and automate the process of creating control features 
# based on provided arguments. In general, feature interfaces define two sets 
# of features: commands and parameters. It is assumed that the controlled 
# emitter expects to receive exactly one activated value for each command 
# feature dimension at each time step. For parameters, it is assumed that each 
# parameter dimension contains exactly one value, and what is desired is an 
# activation strength for that value.

# Below, we specify the control interface for the ParamSet emitter that will 
# serve to control gating in our simulation. The tag argument will be passed in 
# as the tag for the command features, whereas vals defines the values of these 
# features. The value semantics are defined by the order of the elements passed 
# to vals and is reflected by the chosen value strings. The clients argument 
# specifies the constructs for which parameters will be emitted. Basically, the 
# emitter will map activations of its parameter features to the client 
# constructs and output the result. The func argument specifies how to map 
# parameter dimensions to clients, taking in a client construct and outputting 
# the corresponding dimensional tag. Finally, the param_val argument specifies 
# the expected feature value for parameter features.

gate_interface = ParamSet.Interface(
    tag="gate",
    clients={
        flow_in("stimulus"),
        flow_tt("associations"),
        flow_bt("main")
    },
    func=lambda c: ("gate", c.ctype.name, c.cid),
)

# Feature interfaces often also define default values for commands. For this 
# simulation, we would like the default values to be selected unless some other 
# command receives higher activation. To do this, we will setup a constant 
# buffer to activate default values to a constant level. 

# To set up default action activations using numdicts. Numdicts, numerical 
# dictionaries, are a pyClarion native datatype. Fundamentally, they are fancy 
# wrappers around dictionaries that allow for mathematical operations. 
# Operations are carried out elementwise, where elements are matched by keys.
# Mathematical operations are supported between numdicts and constant numerical 
# values (ints, floats, etc.). Furthermore, numdicts typically define default 
# values for missing keys, which are appropriately updated under mathematical 
# operations.
 
# In this particular simulation, we set our default action values to have a 
# constant activation of 0.5

default_strengths = nd.MutableNumDict(default=0)
default_strengths.extend(gate_interface.defaults, value=0.5)

# We initialize and populate chunk and rule databases as in 
# `free_association.py`.

cdb = Chunks()
rule_db = Rules()

rule_db.define(
    rule("1"), 
    cdb.define( 
        chunk("FRUIT"),
        feature("tasty", True),
        feature("sweet", True)
    ),
    cdb.define( 
        chunk("APPLE"), 
        feature("color", "#ff0000"),

    )
)

    chunk("JUICE"),
    feature("tasty", True),
    feature("state", "liquid")

### Agent Assembly ###

# The agent assembly process is very similar to `free_association.py`, but we 
# define some additional constructs and structures.

# Note that we place a handle to the gate interface at the agent level.

    # The acs_ctrl construct is an entry point for manually passing in commands 
    # to the action-centered subsystem (ACS). Normally, the ACS would select 
    # actions based on perceptual stimuli, working memory etc. For simplicity, 
    # we directly stimulate the action features in the ACS to drive action 
    # selection.

    # In this simulation, we add an entirely new subsystem to the model: the 
    # action-centered subystem, which handles action selection. This subsystem 
    # takes inputs from the acs_ctrl and default buffers, and it has its own 
    # activation sequence as specified by ACSCycle.

        # We define an action terminus in ACS for controlling flow gating in 
        # NACS. To do this, we make use of the ActionSelector emitter, which 
        # selects, for each command dimension in its client interface, a single 
        # value through boltzmann sampling, and forwards activations of any 
        # parameter features defined in the interface.

        # pool, as in `free_association.py`, would result in a feed-back loop

        # do not gate the stimulus buffer. Instead, we create a flow_in 
        # construct which repeats the output of the stimulus buffer and gate 
        # that. To implement the gate, we initialize a `Gated` object which 
        # wraps the activation repeater.

        # terminus is unchanged from `free_association.py`.
