"""A very simple example of NACS-style operation on an item in the style of 
Raven's Progressive Matrices. This example uses only the basic constructs. It 
is meant to demonstrate how these components can be combined to give rise to 
the kinds of processes that are normally controlled by various subsystems such 
as ACS, NACS, MS, and MCS. Learning is not treated in this example.

The item matrix has the following structure:

    triangle  square    circle
    circle    triangle  square
    square    circle    ?

The alternatives are: triangle, circle, square.

The goal is to choose the alternative that best completes the matrix.

For simplicity, this example only uses row-wise reasoning.

####### PROCESSING EXAMPLE #######

# Step 1: Activate matrix sequence chunks.

initial = {matseq1 : 1., matseq2 : 1.}

# Step 2: Use SBR. 
    # Activate any similar chunks.

    ## Step 2.1: Top-Down Activation

top_down = with_channels(initial, top_downs, max_junction)

    ## Step 2.2: Bottom-Up Activation
        # The resulting activations from the top-down step are now used for 
        # bottom up activation. Normally, activations would spread throughout 
        # the top and bottom levels before this step. In this case, there are 
        # no rules connecting matrix sequences to other sequences, and no 
        # implicit connections. Thus this step is essentially skipped. 

bottom_up = with_channels(top_down, bottom_ups, max_junction)

# The result of this operation is a chunk2strength mapping denoting 
# activation due to similarity.

# Step 3: Rule Application

results = with_channels(bottom_up, rules, max_junction)

####### ALTERNATIVE SELECTION #######
    # At the end of all this reasoning, we choose an alternative, here using a 
    # boltzmann distribution. Given the setup of the scenario and model, this 
    # chunk should likely be chunk alt1 (the correct response). A correct 
    # response is not guaranteed due to the random nature of response selection.

choice = boltzmann_selector(results)
execute_action(choice)

# Now we can check if the response was correct using response_tracker.
