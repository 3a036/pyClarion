"""Demonstration and recipe for chunk extraction in pyClarion."""

from pyClarion import *

# Let's simulate a subject named 'Alice' who is shopping for some fruits. 
# This simulation demonstrates a basic recipe for chunk extraction in 
# pyClarion. If you have not worked through the free association example, 
# please do so first, as you will be missing some of the prerequisite ideas.

# The basic premise of the recipe is to create a special response construct 
# for chunk extraction. On each cycle, this construct recommends new chunks 
# based on the state of the bottom level. These recommendations are then picked 
# up by an updater object, which adds any new chunks to its client chunk 
# database and to affected subsystem(s). At this time the recipe and associated 
# objects are highly experimental.

# Here is the scenario:
# Alice has implicit knowledge about fruits and prices, but is new to the 
# store so she doesn't have any explicit knowledge about store prices. As a 
# result, she is surveying the prices to form some explicit, crystalized 
# knowledge.

### Setup ###

### Agent Setup ###

# Agent setup proceeds more or less as with the free association example. 
# Except that we include a `ChunkAdder` object as an updater when we initialize 
# the agent realizer. 

# The `ChunkAdder` object assumes the chunk database it is responsible for 
# lives in the same realizer as itself. Minimally, the ChunkAdder needs to 
# be given a response construct to monitor and a specification for constructing 
# node realizers. Since, in this particular case, the adder lives at the agent 
# level, it is also told which subsystem it should monitor.

            ),
        ),
        response=response("Extractor"),
        subsystem=subsystem("NACS")
    )
)

stimulus = Construct(name=buffer("Stimulus"), propagator=Stimulus())
alice.add(stimulus)

# For this example, we create a simple NACS w/ horizontal flows (no rules, no 
# associative memory networks).

nacs = Structure(

# For the purposes of this example, we continue in the domain of fruits. Fruits 
# are coded as individual values of a "fruits" dimension. Prices are also coded 
# on a five-point scale ranging from "very cheap" to "fair" to "very expensive".
# This encoding is not particularly sophisticated from a psychological point of 
# view, and probably completely unrealistic. It is for illustration purposes 
# only.

# This simple simulation sought to demonstrate the following:
#   - The basics of using updaters for learning, and
#   - A recipe for chunk extraction from the state of the bottom level.
