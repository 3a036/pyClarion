"""Demonstration and recipe for chunk extraction in pyClarion."""

from pyClarion import *

# Let's simulate a subject named 'Alice' who is shopping for some fruits. 
# This simulation demonstrates a basic recipe for chunk extraction in 
# pyClarion. If you have not worked through the free association example, 
# please do so first, as you will be missing some of the prerequisite ideas.

# The basic premise of the recipe is to create a special terminus construct 
# for chunk extraction. On each cycle, this construct recommends new chunks 
# based on the state of the bottom level. These recommendations are then picked 
# up by an updater object, which adds any new chunks to its client chunk 
# database and to affected subsystem(s). At this time the recipe and associated 
# objects are highly experimental.

# Here is the scenario:
# Alice has implicit knowledge about fruits and prices, but is new to the 
# store so she doesn't have any explicit knowledge about store prices. As a 
# result, she is surveying the prices to form some explicit, crystalized 
# knowledge.

### Setup ###

### Agent Setup ###

# Agent setup proceeds more or less as with the free association example. 
# Except that we include a `ChunkAdder` object as an updater when we initialize 
# the agent realizer. 

# The `ChunkAdder` object assumes the chunk database it is responsible for 
# lives in the same realizer as itself. Minimally, the ChunkAdder needs to 
# be given a terminus construct to monitor and a specification for constructing 
# node realizers. Since, in this particular case, the adder lives at the agent 
# level, it is also told which subsystem it should monitor.

# This simple simulation sought to demonstrate the following:
#   - The basics of using updaters for learning, and
#   - A recipe for chunk extraction from the state of the bottom level.
